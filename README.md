# attendance
Python program to take the attendance of a class (originally meant from Zoom)

The students are supposed to enter their names into the Zoom chat.
Then, the person taking the attendance should save the meeting chat onto his/her PC.

Prerequisite:
You must have a csv file containing the names of all the students in your class.
You can use any online converter to convert a txt/excel file into a csv. Rename it to students.csv and keep it in the same directory or edit the program accordingly.

The name entered in the Zoom chat should match with the names in the csv file.
